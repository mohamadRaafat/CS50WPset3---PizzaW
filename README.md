# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

- PizzaW is a pizza ordering website. A user can go to the menu page and choose the food.
- Then, the user can go to the cart to confirm the order. There's a order history page to track all orders
- Restaurant's admin can view all users' orders and confirm them

**Personal Touch**
- An order is pending in the orders history page
- Once the order is confirmed by the restaurant's admin, the state changes from pending to confirmed and is visible to the user.
